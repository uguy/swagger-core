# Swagger Sample App

## Overview
This is a grails project to build a stand-alone server which implements the Swagger spec.  You can find out more about both the spec and the framework at http://swagger.io.  For more information about Wordnik's APIs, please visit http://developer.wordnik.com.  There is an online version similar to this server at http://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json

### Running the app
You do not need to install Grails separately to run this project.  

To start simply run:

```
./grailsw run-app
```

This will download required framework files and dependencies and start the app on port 8080.  You can then navigate to the swagger-ui here:

```
http://localhost:8080/java-grails2/index.html
```
